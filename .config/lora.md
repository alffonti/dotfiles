Hi Lora.
Megan got $30 for the first session.
During the meeting, we agreed on an upfront payment of 3 hours ($60) concerning the header and footer layout design.
Once I get the payment, I'll start working on it.
I'll delete the email as soon as I access the website.
Thanks!
Alf

Oops! Sorry. i just sent the $60 to Megan.
